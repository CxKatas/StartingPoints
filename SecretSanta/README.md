Secret Santa Kata
==================

Secret Santa is a Western Christmas tradition in which members of a group or community (e.g., family, co-workers) are assigned a person to whom they anonymously give a gift; thus “Secret Santa”.*

Assume you need to create a method or routine that will consume a list of participants and will produce a valid map (pairs) between the participants. 

Write the code following the **Three Laws of TDD**:

> 1. Do not write any production code unless is to pass a failing unit tests
> 2. Do not write more than unit test that is sufficient to fail
> 3. Write just enough code to pass the one failing unit test

Ensure the code satisfy the **Four Rules of Simple Design**:
> 1. All the tests pass
> 2. No duplicated code exists
> 3. Code is self explanatory
> 4. No superflows parts exist
